# Releases-Regex Repo
This repository contains **regular expressions (regexes) for the best and recommended release groups**, sourced from [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info).

> TRaSH Guides is a community-driven resource offering clear, step-by-step guides for optimizing your media management tools—primarily Sonarr for TV shows and Radarr for Movies. Born from a personal quest to fine-tune quality profiles and release preferences, these guides break down complex configurations into easy-to-follow instructions.
